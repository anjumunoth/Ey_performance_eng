CPU intensive app or memory intensive app

Scenario 1: 1 lakh line and 10 workers
	Optimised option; cpu -- less ; memory each thread 10000lines
Scenario 2: 1 lakh line and 10000 workers
cpu -- more ; memory each thread 10lines

Scenario 3: 10000 line and 1 workers
cpu -- less ; memory each thread 10000lines

Scenario 4: 10000 line and 100 workers
cpu -- little more ; memory each thread 100 lines


Optimisation : Number of threads -- number of lines 
Larger the file -- lesser the number of threads
Smaller the file -- lesser the number of threads


Number of threads -- More threads -- more memory 
More number of line -- more memory
More threads -- memory (reclaim can happen, lesser number of lines to be processed) may be properly utilised
Lesser threads -- lesser process memory

Balance between the number of threads and number of lines each thread will process()
12 lakh lines; 3 worker threads
12 lakh lines; 6 worker threads -- best
1200 lakh lines; 20 worker threads
1200 lakh lines; 200 worker threads -- best
