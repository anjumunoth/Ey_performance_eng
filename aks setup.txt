Okay, assuming you've got both FactApiService and GreetingComposerService running locally and GreetingComposerService can successfully call FactApiService (meaning you get a proper greeting with a fact in your browser when you hit the /api/greeting/{name} endpoint), here are the next steps to get this deployed to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) and test the features you originally requested:

Phase 1: Containerization and Azure Setup

Ensure Docker is Installed and Running: You'll need Docker to build images.

Azure Account and CLI:

Ensure you have an Azure account (Pay-as-you-go or Free account with credits).

Install and log in to the Azure CLI (az login).

Create Azure Resources (if not already done from previous examples):

Resource Group:
# Or your preferred region
az group create --name GreetingAppRG --location eastus 


Azure Container Registry (ACR): To store your Docker images.
Use Azure Cloud Shell (Bash environment) in your browser or  Install Git Bash (comes with Git for Windows). This gives you a Bash-like environment.

Open Git Bash from the project folder:
Search for "Git Bash" in your Windows Start Menu and open it. You'll get a terminal window that looks similar to a Linux terminal.
Ensure Azure CLI is Accessible:
If you installed Azure CLI using the Windows MSI installer, Git Bash should typically be able to find it in your system's PATH.
Type az --version and press Enter. If you see the Azure CLI version information, you're good to go.
If not, you might need to ensure the Azure CLI installation directory (usually something like C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Azure\CLI2\wbin or C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Azure\CLI2\wbin) is added to your Windows System PATH environment variable, and then restart Git Bash.
Log in to Azure (if you haven't already in this session):
az login

This will open a browser window for you to authenticate.
Run the Commands:
You can now run the original commands directly as they were intended for a Bash environment.
# 0. First, ensure the Resource Group exists (run this once if it's not already created)
az group create --name GreetingAppRG --location eastus # Or your preferred region

# 1. Set the ACR_NAME variable with a random suffix
#    (openssl should be available within Git Bash's minimal Unix-like environment)
ACR_NAME="greetingappregistry$(openssl rand -hex 3)"
echo "Generated ACR Name: $ACR_NAME"

# 2. Create the Azure Container Registry
az acr create --resource-group GreetingAppRG --name $ACR_NAME --sku Basic --admin-enabled true

If u get an error ,This error occurs because your Azure subscription is not registered to use the Microsoft.ContainerService resource provider, which is required for creating an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.
Register via Azure Portal
- Go to the Azure Portal.
- Navigate to Subscriptions.
- Select your subscription.
- Click on Resource Providers in settings.
- Search for Microsoft.ContainerService and click Register.
Once the provider is registered, retry your command:


# 3. Get the ACR login server name and store it in a variable
ACR_LOGIN_SERVER=$(az acr show --name $ACR_NAME --query loginServer --output tsv)

# 4. Display the ACR login server
echo "ACR Login Server: $ACR_LOGIN_SERVER"

# Reminder: For production, use service principals instead of --admin-enabled





Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS):

AKS_CLUSTER_NAME="greetingappaks"
az aks create \
    --resource-group GreetingAppRG \
    --name $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME \
    --node-count 1 \
    --node-vm-size Standard_B2s \
    --enable-managed-identity \
    --generate-ssh-keys
# Get credentials for kubectl
az aks get-credentials --resource-group GreetingAppRG --name $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME --overwrite-existing
kubectl get nodes # Verify connection




Build Docker Images:
In git bash, navigate to the project folder 

For FactApiService:

cd FactApiService
docker build -t $ACR_LOGIN_SERVER/factapiservice:v1 .
cd ..

For GreetingComposerService:

cd GreetingComposerService
docker build -t $ACR_LOGIN_SERVER/greetingcomposerservice:v1 .
cd ..

Push Docker Images to ACR:

Login to ACR (if using admin user, password can be retrieved; for service principal, docker login with SP credentials). The az acr login command simplifies this for your current Azure CLI user if they have permissions.

az acr login --name $ACR_NAME


Push the images:

docker push $ACR_LOGIN_SERVER/factapiservice:v1
docker push $ACR_LOGIN_SERVER/greetingcomposerservice:v1


Phase 2: Kubernetes Manifests and Deployment

Create a k8s Directory: In your project root directory.

mkdir k8s
cd k8s

Create Kubernetes Manifest YAML Files:

00-namespace.yaml:

        # - name: DOTNET_GCHeapHardLimitPercent
        #   value: "70"

ACTION: Replace YOUR_ACR_LOGIN_SERVER with your actual ACR login server name.

        #   value: "Development_Swagger"
        resources:
          requests:
            memory: "128Mi"
            cpu: "100m"
          limits:
            memory: "384Mi" # Slightly more for HttpClient and string ops
            cpu: "700m"
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /health
            port: 8080
          initialDelaySeconds: 15
          periodSeconds: 5
        livenessProbe:

          initialDelaySeconds: 30
          periodSeconds: 15

ACTION: Replace YOUR_ACR_LOGIN_SERVER.

Note the FactService__BaseUrl environment variable. This uses Kubernetes DNS to resolve the factapiservice Service we defined in 02-factapi-service.yaml. The format is http://<service-name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local:<service-port>. If the service port is 80, you can sometimes omit it and the namespace if calling from within the same namespace, simplifying to http://factapiservice. Using the FQDN is more robust.

04-greetingcomposer-service.yaml: (External service to access GreetingComposerService)

apiVersion: v1

(No KEDA for these services): KEDA is for event-driven scaling (like queue length). These services are HTTP-driven, so standard HPA based on CPU/memory is appropriate. If FactApiService was, for example, processing items from a queue pushed by GreetingComposerService, then KEDA would be relevant for FactApiService.

Deploy to AKS:
Navigate to your k8s directory in git bash:

Apply the namespace:

kubectl apply -f namespace.yaml
Apply the deployments and services:

kubectl apply -f factapi-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f factapi-service.yaml # The order between these two usually doesn't matter critically

kubectl apply -f greetingcomposer-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f greetingcomposer-service.yaml

kubectl apply -f factapi-hpa.yaml
kubectl apply -f greetingcomposer-hpa.yaml

Verify Deployments:

kubectl get all -n greeting-app
kubectl get hpa -n greeting-app
# Wait for greetingcomposer-service EXTERNAL-IP
kubectl get svc greetingcomposer-service -n greeting-app --watch


# Set your variables
RG_NAME="GreetingAppRG"
AKS_CLUSTER_NAME="greetingappaks"


az aks update -n $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME -g $RG_NAME --attach-acr $ACR_NAME

Monitor the new pods:
kubectl get pods -n greeting-app -l app=greetingcomposer -w


Phase 3: Testing AKS Features

Test Basic Functionality:

Once greetingcomposer-service has an EXTERNAL-IP, test it in your browser:
http://<EXTERNAL-IP>/api/greeting/AKSUser
http://4.255.32.28/api/greeting/AKSUser 

Check logs of both services to see the call flow:

kubectl logs -n greeting-app -l app=factapi -f
kubectl logs -n greeting-app -l app=greetingcomposer -f

Test Load Balancing (for GreetingComposerService):
Load balancing for your GreetingComposerService is handled by the Azure Load Balancer that was provisioned when you created the Kubernetes Service of type: LoadBalancer. This Load Balancer distributes incoming requests across all the healthy and ready pods backing that service.
To effectively test and observe load balancing, you ideally need:
Multiple healthy and ready replicas (pods) of GreetingComposerService.
A way to distinguish which pod is serving a request (usually through logs).
A way to send multiple requests.

If you manually scale greetingcomposer-deployment to more than 1 replica (kubectl scale deployment greetingcomposer-deployment --replicas=3 -n greeting-app), requests to the EXTERNAL-IP should be distributed. HPA will do this automatically under load.


If you want to quickly see load balancing without waiting for HPA to react to significant load, you can manually scale the deployment:
kubectl scale deployment greetingcomposer-deployment --replicas=3 -n greeting-app
Wait for the new pods to become Running and READY 1/1:
kubectl get pods -n greeting-app -l app=greetingcomposer -w

Step 2: Prepare to Observe Logs
Your GreetingComposerService logs messages like "Greeting requested for name: {Name}". When multiple pods are running, each request will hit one of them.
Stream logs from all greetingcomposer pods:
Open a new terminal window and run:
kubectl logs -n greeting-app -l app=greetingcomposer -f --tail=10
This command will follow (-f) the logs from all pods matching the label app=greetingcomposer. Each log line is usually prefixed with the pod's name, so you can see which pod handled which request.

Step 3: Send Multiple Requests
You can do this in a few ways:
Manually from your browser:
Get the EXTERNAL-IP of your greetingcomposer-service:
EXTERNAL_IP=$(kubectl get svc greetingcomposer-service -n greeting-app -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
echo $EXTERNAL_IP
Open http://$EXTERNAL_IP/api/greeting/TestUser1 in your browser.
Observe the kubectl logs ... terminal. Note which pod served the request.
Refresh the browser or open http://$EXTERNAL_IP/api/greeting/TestUser2.
Observe the logs again. Ideally, if you have multiple replicas, the request might go to a different pod. The default load balancing algorithm is typically round-robin, but with just a few manual requests, you might hit the same pod a couple of times due to session affinity settings in the load balancer (if any, though default is usually none or source IP based) or just the nature of small numbers.

Step 4: Scale Back Down (if manually scaled)
If you manually scaled up with kubectl scale, remember to scale back down if you want HPA to manage it from its minReplicas:
# kubectl scale deployment greetingcomposer-deployment --replicas=1 -n greeting-app
# Or let HPA take over by just removing the manual replica count override (though HPA will eventually bring it down if load is low)

Test Auto Scaling (HPA):

FactApiService:

Generate load on its /api/fact/complex?complexity=X endpoint. You can do this from within a pod in the cluster or expose factapiservice with a temporary LoadBalancer service for external testing.

Example using a temporary port-forward (less ideal for sustained load but good for a quick check):

# In one terminal:
kubectl port-forward svc/factapiservice 8888:80 -n greeting-app
# In another terminal (requires a load testing tool like 'hey'):
# go install github.com/rakyll/hey@latest
hey -z 30s -c 10 "http://localhost:8888/api/fact/complex?complexity=5"

Watch HPA: kubectl get hpa factapi-hpa -n greeting-app -w

GreetingComposerService:

Generate load on http://<EXTERNAL-IP>/api/greeting/SomeName

EXTERNAL_IP=$(kubectl get svc greetingcomposer-service -n greeting-app -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
hey -z 1m -c 20 "http://$EXTERNAL_IP/api/greeting/LoadTestUser"

Watch HPA: kubectl get hpa greetingcomposer-hpa -n greeting-app -w

Test Configuring Garbage Collection & Tuning Memory Parameters:

Observe Baseline: Check kubectl top pods -n greeting-app and pod logs.

Modify Deployment:

Edit 01-factapi-deployment.yaml or 03-greetingcomposer-deployment.yaml.

Add/uncomment env variables for DOTNET_gcServer, DOTNET_GCHeapHardLimitPercent, etc.

Adjust resources.requests.memory and resources.limits.memory.

Apply Changes: kubectl apply -f <filename>.yaml

Generate Load: Use the complex fact endpoint for FactApiService or high traffic for GreetingComposerService.

Observe: Check kubectl top pods, logs, and kubectl describe pod <pod-name> -n greeting-app for OOMKilled events if limits are too low. Use dotnet-counters inside the pod for detailed GC stats.

Phase 4: Cleanup (Important for Cost Saving)

Delete Resources:

Delete individual deployments/services/HPAs:

kubectl delete -f . -n greeting-app # If in the k8s directory
kubectl delete ns greeting-app

Stop or Delete AKS Cluster:

az aks stop --name $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group GreetingAppRG
# OR to delete completely:
# az aks delete --name $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group GreetingAppRG --yes --no-wait

Delete ACR and Resource Group (if completely done):

# az acr delete --name $ACR_NAME --resource-group GreetingAppRG --yes
# az group delete --name GreetingAppRG --yes --no-wait






1. Stop the AKS Cluster (Deallocates Worker Nodes)
When you stop an AKS cluster, the following happens:
The Kubernetes control plane remains running (the management of AKS itself is free).
All your worker nodes (Virtual Machines) are deallocated. This means you stop paying for the compute hours for these VMs.
The state of your cluster, including your deployed applications and configurations, is preserved.
Persistent Volumes (like Azure Disks attached to your pods via PVCs) will still exist and incur storage costs.
Public IP addresses associated with LoadBalancer services will typically remain allocated and might incur a small cost.
Command to Stop:
# Ensure your variables are set or replace them directly
# RG_NAME="GreetingAppRG"
# AKS_CLUSTER_NAME="greetingappaks"

az aks stop --name $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RG_NAME
This command can take a few minutes to complete as it shuts down and deallocates all the nodes in your node pools.
You can check the status in the Azure portal or by running az aks show --name $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RG_NAME --query "powerState.code" (it should eventually show Deallocated for nodes or Stopped for the cluster).
While the cluster is stopped:
You cannot deploy new applications or manage workloads using kubectl.
Your applications will be unavailable as the pods are not running.
The EXTERNAL-IP for your LoadBalancer services will still be reserved but won't route traffic to any running application.
2. Start the AKS Cluster (Reallocates and Starts Worker Nodes)
When you're ready to use the cluster again, you can start it. This will:
Provision and start new worker nodes (or re-start the previously deallocated ones).
Restore your Kubernetes control plane and workloads.
Your deployed applications will start up according to their deployment specifications.
Command to Start:
# Ensure your variables are set or replace them directly
# RG_NAME="GreetingAppRG"
# AKS_CLUSTER_NAME="greetingappaks"

az aks start --name $AKS_CLUSTER_NAME --resource-group $RG_NAME
This command will also take several minutes to complete as it provisions and starts the nodes and re-establishes the Kubernetes cluster components.
Once started, your applications should become available again. You might need to wait for pods to initialize and Load Balancers to re-establish their health checks.


To check the status
 kubectl get pods -n greeting-app -l app=greetingcomposer -w
